# MAM4xx

This repository contains the source code for a performance-portable C++
implementation of the MAM4 modal aerosol model (with 4 fixed modes).

## Required Software

To build MAM4xx, you need:

* [CMake v3.12+](https://cmake.org/)
* GNU Make
* reliable C and C++ compilers
* a working MPI installation (like [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) or
  [Mpich](https://www.mpich.org/))
* the [HAERO](https://github.com/eagles-project/haero) aerosol package interface,
  which provides necessary libraries and settings.

If you want to compare MAM4xx's processes and parameterizations with the
[MAM4 microphysics box model](https://github.com/eagles-project/mam_refactor),
you also need decent Fortran compiler, such as GNU `gfortran` or Intel's `ifort`
compiler.

You can obtain all of these (except perhaps your favorite Fortran compiler)
freely on the Linux and Mac platforms. On Linux, just use your favorite package
manager. On a Mac, you can get the Clang C/C++ compiler by installing XCode, and
then use a package manager like [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) to get the rest.

For example, to download the relevant software on your Mac using Homebrew, type

```
brew install cmake gfortran openmpi
```

## Building MAM4xx

To configure MAM4xx:

1. Make sure you have the latest versions of all the required submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Create a build directory by running the `setup` script from the top-level
   source directory:
   ```
   ./setup build
   ```
3. Change to your build directory and edit the `config.sh` file to select
   configuration options. Then run `./config.sh` to configure the model. MAM4xx
   gets most of its configuration information from HAERO, so there aren't many
   options here.
4. From the build directory, type `make -j` to build the library. (If you're
   building MAM4xx for GPUs, place a number after the `-j` flag, as in
   `make -j 8`).
5. To run tests for the library (and the driver, if configured), type
   `make test`.
6. To install the model to the location indicated by `PREFIX` in your
   `config.sh` script, type `make install`. By default, products are installed
   in `include`, `lib`, `bin`, and `share` Ñ•ubdirectories within your build
   directory.

### Making code changes and rebuilding

This project uses **build trees** that are separate from source trees. This
is standard practice in CMake-based build systems, and it allows you to build
several different configurations without leaving generated and compiled files
all over your source directory. However, you might have to change the way you
work in order to be productive in this kind of environment.

When you make a code change, make sure you build from the build directory that
you created in step 1 above:

```
cd /path/to/mam4xx/build
make -j
```

You can also run tests from this build directory with `make test`.

This is very different from how some people like to work. One method of making
this easier is to use an editor in a dedicated window, and have another window
open with a terminal, sitting in your `build` directory.

The build directory has a structure that mirrors the source directory, and you
can type `make` in any one of its subdirectories to do partial builds. In
practice, though, it's safest to always build from the top of the build tree.

## Generating Documentation

Documentation for MAM4xx can be built using
[`mkdocs`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
In order to build and view the
documentation, you must download `mkdocs` and its Material theme:

```pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material```

Then, run `mkdocs serve` from the root directory of your MAM4xx repo,
and point your browser to [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).
